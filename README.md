# CCSD Canvas
Canvas is a leading provider of Learning Management System software for education, with an incredible capacity for allowing institutions to modify and improve the experience and requirements for its users. This repo is a collection of code that customizes or adds features and functionality to Instructure Canvas LMS. 

This repo is an effort by the CCSD Canvas Team to establish a give-and-take relationship with the Canvas Community. Education is often limited by funding, and developers and development are expensive. The Clark County School District is the 5th largest K-12 School District in the United States and we have been using Canvas since 2013, and have had time to develop some very robust and quality features for our needs. Many of these solutions solve specific *large institution* problems. It is our goal to share some of our solutions to the community in order prevent duplication of effort, in turn allowing institutions time to focus on ideas they can contribute to the community.

## What's Provided
This repo is dedicated to customizing [Canvas Themes](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-upload-custom-JavaScript-and-CSS-files-to-an-account/ta-p/253), with features and solutions that we feel will benefit the Canvas Community the most or are based on ideas/feedback from the Community.

The code here is provided as is, with no warranty, but please feel free to engage us on the Canvas Community.
