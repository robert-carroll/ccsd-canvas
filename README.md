# CCSD Canvas
Canvas is a leading provider of Learning Management System software for education, with an incredible capacity for allowing institutions to modify and improve the experience and requirements for its users. This repo is a collection of code that customizes or adds features and functionality to Instructure Canvas LMS. 

This repo is an effort by the CCSD Canvas Team to establish a give-and-take relationship with the Canvas Community. Education is often limited by funding, and developers and development are expensive. The Clark County School District is the 5th largest K-12 School District in the United States and we have been using Canvas since 2013, and have had time to develop some very robust and quality features for our needs. Many of these solutions solve specific *large institution* problems. It is our goal to expose some of our solutions to the community in order prevent duplication of effort, in turn allowing institutions time to focus on ideas they can contribute to the community.

The code here is provided as is with no warranty, but please feel free to engage us on the Canvas Community.

## What's Provided
This repo will expand as we release features and solutions that we feel will benefit the Canvas Community the most. We plan to share end user customizations and features, as well as data tools and analytics. These may include:

* JavaScript & CSS
* Canvas Data queries
* Visualizations
* Analytics

## Support
Once again, the code here is provided as is, with no warranty. Instructure nor CCSD can support your use of this code.

We will make every attempt to review and update the code in this repo as we review its use in our own code-base. We strongly suggest reviewing the [Canvas Release Notes](https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers/releases) and the Canvas 3 week production cycle. We review our code in beta in order to prevent production issues, we suggest you do the same.
